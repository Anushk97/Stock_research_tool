      "The sentiment in these headlines ranges from negative to positive. Several headlines comment on issues facing Tesla and Elon Musk, such as tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles or an alleged decrease in Model Y production, giving a negative connotation. However, many headlines highlight Tesla's progress, like its new manufacturing plans and advancements in AI or self-driving technology, which suggest a more positive sentiment. Others focus on how Tesla's performance compares with that of competitors such as Nvdia and Rivian or the state of the EV market in general, providing a neutral, informational tone. Overall, the sentiment appears to be mixed, reflecting the complexities and challenges in the current dynamic EV industry including myriad issues Musk and Tesla face.\n"
